- Added GetProjectIssue method to Client interface
- Implemented GetProjectIssue in client.go using IssuesService.GetIssue
- Added mock implementation in mockClient with issue and issueErr fields
- Updated AGENTS.md with note about Issue IID being int64
- All acceptance criteria met

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Existing GetIssues method already had state filter and pagination
- GitLab SDK method signature: (s *IssuesService) GetIssue(pid any, issue int64, options ...RequestOptionFunc)
- Always add both interface method and mock implementation when adding new API methods
- Issue IID is internal ID within a project, different from global ID
