## Codebase Patterns
- Use bubbletea framework for TUI (modern, well-maintained)
- Project follows standard Go layout: cmd/ for entry point, pkg/ for packages
- Makefile targets: build, run, test, lint, clean, install
- Always run `make build` and `make test` before committing
- Binary output directory: bin/

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Initialized Go module (github.com/davzucky/lazygitlab)
- Integrated bubbletea TUI framework
- Created basic main.go with empty TUI window
- Created Makefile with build, run, test, lint, clean, install targets
- Created .gitignore for Go projects
- Project compiles and runs successfully
- Fixed .gitignore issue where "lazygitlab" pattern was ignoring cmd/lazygitlab directory (changed to /lazygitlab to only match root binary)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Use bubbletea framework for TUI (modern, well-maintained)
- Project follows standard Go layout: cmd/ for entry point, pkg/ for packages
- Makefile targets: build, run, test, lint, clean, install
- Always run `make build` and `make test` before committing
- Binary output directory: bin/
- ralph.sh script expects PRD in scripts/ directory, not tasks/
- PRD must have "branchName" field and "passes" field for each user story
