Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Added GetProjectIssue method to Client interface
- Implemented GetProjectIssue in client.go using IssuesService.GetIssue
- Added mock implementation in mockClient with issue and issueErr fields
- Updated AGENTS.md with note about Issue IID being int64
- All acceptance criteria met

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Existing GetIssues method already had state filter and pagination
- GitLab SDK method signature: (s *IssuesService) GetIssue(pid any, issue int64, options ...RequestOptionFunc)
- Always add both interface method and mock implementation when adding new API methods
- Issue IID is internal ID within a project, different from global ID

- Added State and UpdatedAt fields to ListItem struct
- Added imports for sort, strings, time, and gitlab SDK
- Updated renderMainPanel to show issue-specific format: state icon + IID + truncated title
- State icon: ● for open, ○ for closed
- Added IssuesToListItems helper function to convert gitlab.Issue to ListItem
- Implemented sorting by UpdatedAt descending
- Added truncateString helper for title truncation (max 60 chars)
- Updated renderDetailsPanel to show issue-specific details when in IssuesView
- Updated empty state message for issues ("No issues found")
- All acceptance criteria met

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Use state icons (●/○) instead of text for more compact display
- truncateString with "... " suffix is better than simple truncation
- sort.Slice with After() comparison for descending date order
- ListItem struct can be extended with more fields without breaking existing code
- Current view checking (m.currentView == IssuesView) allows conditional rendering
