## Codebase Patterns
- Use bubbletea framework for TUI (modern, well-maintained)
- Project follows standard Go layout: cmd/ for entry point, pkg/ for packages
- Makefile targets: build, run, test, lint, clean, install
- Always run `make build` and `make test` before committing
- Binary output directory: bin/
