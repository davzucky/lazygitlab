- Extended ListItem struct to include full issue details: description, author, created date, labels, assignees, milestone
- Updated IssuesToListItems() to populate all new fields from gitlab.Issue objects
- Enhanced renderDetailsPanel() to display comprehensive issue information with conditional field display
- Implemented description truncation with scroll hint for long content
- Updated AGENTS.md with Data Display patterns for extending ListItem and rendering details

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- When extending ListItem struct, always update the corresponding *ToListItems conversion function to populate new fields
- GitLab API provides rich data (author, labels, assignees, milestone) - use gitlab.Issue type directly to access all fields
- Use conditional checks (e.g., `if len(item.Assignees) > 0`) to display optional fields in UI
- For multi-line text content, use strings.Split() to break into individual lines and implement line count limits with scroll hints
- The Details Panel height in styles.go is currently set to 10, which may need adjustment for longer content displays
